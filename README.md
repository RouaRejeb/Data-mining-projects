# Data-mining-projects
This GitHub repository contains my personal data mining projects where I apply the concepts I learn in university. Topics include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering, and association rule mining. Code is in Python and uses pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Feedback is welcome.
